Design Philosophy
=================

A service design methodology was used to assemble Mantl components. Priority was given
to sensing the large shifts in this technology and to defining an architecture 
consistent with traditional,sequential as well as Agile methodologies. Once the architecture
was optimized feedback was requested from enterprise developers and service partners.
Popular open source projects were reviewed in consideration of the stack.

Open source is a big part of the culture we have at Cisco. Once we had the feedback and 
Software options in mind, we created a prototype of Mantl in a project called Microservices
Infrastructure. This project has involved long living aspects of testing, optimizing,
evaluating and scale testing.
 
As we went into the service design phase, we looked at the gaps in today's tools
and what the architure required as we approached those in the project. Our approach
included networking (IP per container/group of containers), service discovery,
service availability, security and application policy. In the end, we had the 
components of Mantl which addressed the architectual needs, "best of breed" technology,
and customer feedback.
